# T-DEV-810

## Machine Learning

- Learn from data
- Find regularities

## Supervised classification

- Cluster information between classes
- Regularity Y=F(X)
    - Y: class
    - X: contains the various parameters
- Build an estimator of F based on sample data


## Image recognition

- Data = bunch of pixels
- Associate pixels with a label

- Start with tagged pictures -> Emulate rules
- Apply rules on unlabeled pictures

## Goal
- Build robust algorithm
- Return reliable predictions
