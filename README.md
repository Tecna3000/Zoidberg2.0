# ZOIDBERG 2.0
### Computer Aided Diagnosis


1. Setup and Data Preparation
    - Install necessary libraries
    - A Jupyter Notebook for the project

2. Data Loading and Exploration
    - Data Loading:
        - Load the datasets using installed libraries (ex: opencv-python)
        - Display the structure and some sample to understand the data format
    - Data Exploration:
        - Visualize some X-Ray images
        - Check the distribution of classes (pneumonia vs no-pneumonia)
        - Analyze basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of image pixel values

3. Data Preprocessing
    - Image Preprocessing:
        - Resize image to a standard size (ex: 224 x 224px)
        - Normalize pixel values to the range [0,1]
        - Perform data augmentation (rotation, scaling, flipping) to increase the diversity of the training data

    - Label encoding:
        - Encode the labels into numerical values if necessary (ex: no-pneumonia = 0; pneumonia = 1)

4. Splitting the Data
    - Train-Validation-Test split:

5. Model Selection and Training
    - 
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Evaluation
8. Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction
9. Final Model Training and Testing
10. Visualization and Interpretation
11. Documentation and Delivery
